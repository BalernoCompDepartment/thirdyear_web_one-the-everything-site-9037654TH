# HTML Task One

Welcome back to HTML and CSS

## The Task

You are going to make a website about Your favourite band, pop group, rock star 
This web site will be where we use all the tags, and focus on (re) learning the tags and what they are used for

The focus will not be on designing a good web page jsut now but on using everything!

## What the website needs!

* Two pages (one is you index.html) lined together
* Two links to external websites
* Four pictures
* Three paragraphs on each page in at least three styles
* Three different styles of heading
* Background colour in one page
* Background image in the other
* A list (either ordered or unordered)
* An Embeded Video

Anything else I think of I will let you know :D
